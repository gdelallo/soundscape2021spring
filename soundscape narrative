Where could you anchor your soundscape?
  I want to focus on calming noises that evoke images of those serene places using soothing noises that fade into one another 
Title: A Summer’s Night Storm
What stories are told there? 
  I want my narrative to revolve around the small details in life, and part of that is achieved by being able to easily fall into the imagery the sound sparks
How do you represent that environment sonically? 
  Crickets and humming bugs; an owl’s hoot; sustained wind; crackles of thunder; the pour of rain; wind hissing; silence; the croaking of frogs;  crickets ad the humming of bugs; a breeze that fades into nothing 
What sounds are relatively stable, and which ones come and go? 
  The stability of my soundscape will found in the soft breeze that is heard throughout the piece. Rain will come and go. I don’t want the rain to drown out all of the other sounds that will create the summer’s air. 
What structures or sequences could help a listening audience follow the story? 
  I will try to blend my sounds into one another, making the story cohesive while also emphasizing the main tonal switch
