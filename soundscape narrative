Added in 3 new sound files and replaced 4 (may use at a different time) 

thought of better plot for  
summer night sounds with me breathing ans flipping book pages 
wind picks up and whistles, wind chimes swing 
wind continues to pick up and rain begins to sprinkle
i slam a door going inside, and the rain is muted 
rain and wind pick up, but is still muted through the window
rain slows and the sounds become sharper, as a window is "opened"
the rain leaves, the bug noises return, and the wind chimes are calm
