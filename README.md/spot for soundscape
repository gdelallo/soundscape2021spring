Soundscape: A Summer's Eve Rain 
The narrative is a progression of someone enjoying their backyard, listening to the distant city, mostly filled with emergency vehicle sounds. As time goes on, the wind and windchimes become louder, and then the rain drops. With the rain disappears the chatter of bugs, now replaced by harsh wind, and the soft patter of rain accompanies an evening indoors, reading a book, listening to the rain, and enjoying it in its full capacity once the window opens, made aparent by the full clarity of the events outside reoccuring once more.
